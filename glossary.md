# Integration Project Glossary

## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and definitions that allows software applications to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data structures that developers can use to interact with the software component.

## REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on a stateless, client-server communication model. RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

## Endpoint
A specific URL at which an API can be accessed by the client. Each endpoint corresponds to a different function or data resource.

## HTTP Methods
Standard methods used in RESTful services to perform operations on resources. Common methods include:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server
- **POST**: Submit data to a server to create/update a resource
- **PUT**: Update a resource on a server
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from a server

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. Commonly used in APIs to exchange data.

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Sometimes used in APIs for data interchange.

## Integration Pattern
A design pattern that provides solutions for integrating systems and applications. Common patterns include:
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication between services using queues.
- **Publish/Subscribe**: A messaging pattern where messages are sent by publishers and received by multiple subscribers.
- **Aggregator**: A pattern that combines multiple messages into a single message.
- **Splitter**: A pattern that splits a single message into multiple messages.

## Mule Runtime
The runtime engine of the Mulesoft platform that runs Mule applications, handling all the integrations and API requests.

## Anypoint Platform
Mulesoft's unified integration platform that allows users to design, build, deploy, and manage APIs and integrations in a single environment.

## API Manager
A component of Anypoint Platform that provides tools for managing and securing APIs, including policies, access control, and analytics.

## DataWeave
A powerful data transformation language used in Mulesoft for transforming data from one format to another (e.g., JSON to XML).

## Flow
A sequence of processing steps in a Mule application that defines how data is received, processed, and transmitted.

## Connector
A reusable component in Mulesoft that allows interaction with different systems, databases, protocols, and APIs.

## Transform Message
A Mule component that uses DataWeave to transform data from one format to another within a Mule flow.

## Listener
A Mule component that waits for incoming messages or events to trigger a flow.

## API Gateway
A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing policies, and passing requests to backend services.

## Orchestration
The automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services.

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML. SOAP APIs are known for their rigid standards and extensive features compared to REST.

## WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
An XML-based language used for describing the functionality offered by a web service. WSDL is used with SOAP APIs.

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
A formal agreement between a service provider and a client that defines the level of service expected from the service provider, including performance metrics and responsibilities.

## OAuth
An open standard for access delegation commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization on the internet.

## Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each implementing a specific business capability.

## ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)
A middleware tool that provides a means for different systems to communicate with each other, enabling integration and communication across disparate systems in an enterprise.

## Asynchronous Communication
A form of communication where the sender and receiver do not need to interact with each other in real-time, often using messaging systems or queues.

## Synchronous Communication
A form of communication where the sender and receiver interact with each other in real-time, waiting for a response before continuing.

## Throttling
A technique used to control the usage of an API by limiting the number of requests that can be made in a given time period.

## Rate Limiting
A technique to control the rate at which clients can make requests to an API, typically to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## Load Balancing
The process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, improving availability and reliability.

## Fault Tolerance
The ability of a system to continue functioning in the event of a failure of some of its components.

## Circuit Breaker
A design pattern used to detect failures and encapsulate the logic of preventing a failure from constantly recurring during maintenance, temporary external system failure, or unexpected system difficulties.

## Message Broker
An intermediary program that translates a message from the formal messaging protocol of the sender to the formal messaging protocol of the receiver.

## API Documentation
Documentation that describes the available endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, and authentication methods for an API, helping developers understand how to use it effectively.

## Swagger/OpenAPI
An open-source framework used for designing, building, and documenting RESTful APIs. It includes a standard specification for describing APIs and tools for generating API documentation.
